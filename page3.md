# Danny's thoughts as he wraps up his College Chapter
## Graduating this Decemeber
### I am looking forward to graduating and seeing whats next.

### I know I am looking for the perfect job and I know my first job won't be perfect but it will put my foot in the door in the tech industry. 

### I really just want to enjoy the work that I am doing and to be happy. 

### I have been in contact with the career services as they have been helping me look for jobs. I don't want to spend any money until I get a job. Once I get a job, I plan to put as much in investing as I possibly can. Luckily thanks to the Evans Scholarship I am able to graduate college without any debt.
