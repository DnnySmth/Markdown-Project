# Thoughts
### The current monitor that I have works. I have had it for 6 years. I don't need to upgrade, but I really want to. In the beginning of Summer I recently Upgraded my GPU from a GTX 1080 to an RTX 4070 so I should be able to run my games with the new monitor, but I do know I would have to upgrade my gpu sooner with this new monitor upgrade.

# Second Option

### Gigabyte M27Q PRO
### 27" 2560 x 1440p 1ms 165hz IPS Panel
### Price: $289

# Thoughts
### This monitor is significantly more affordable than the Alienware. Worthy upgrades is 165hz refresh rate which aint much of a big deal to me in my opinion. And that it is an IPS panel. (Better viewing angels) Not sure how much of a difference if any I would notice. 

# Conclusion
### Still keeping on eye on prices of those monitors as well as others that compete with them. I have a 4k secondary monitor. I don't want to game in 4k as text and format can be too small for a 27' display as well as use more gpu power. I understand that the ultrawide will be using more gpu power. Just not sure if that ultrawide is worth that price, hence it already being a couple years old, and hopefully they will make an oled version.
