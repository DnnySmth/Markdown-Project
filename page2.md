## Looking for Tech Jobs in Chicagoland Area
### Looking for jobs has been difficult, but I'm still applying and putting effort in searching.

### I am passionate about researching tech.
### Currently I've been watching many monitor reveiws.
### Love keeping up with PC hardware, currenly have an i7 9700k (8 cores). Don't have a need to upgrade my cpu now but when the time is right I plan to purchase the i7 14700k, 20 cores is incredible, current m1 pro macbook has 10 cores.
